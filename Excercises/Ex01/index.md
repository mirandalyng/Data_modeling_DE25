# Exercise 1 - going in to logical and physical data modeling

## 0. Library Bookly

When building your logical and physical models, consider these more detailed requirements:

- There can be more than one copy of a book
- For each borrow, member can borrow more than one book copy

Also, think about how the models can be affected if the stakeholders require the database to store also data about (you don't need to update your models but just suggest briefly how the models should be changed):

- Librarians
- Reservation
- Publishers
- Book Categories
